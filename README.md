# BDCC-NSMOD
This mod aims to bring all the customization options that anyone would need.
This mod also adds some modifications that I wanted in the game.

# Confused?
- "mod" refers to BDCC-NSMOD, a modified version of the based game.
- "modification" refers to things in BDCC-NSMOD that aren't in the base game, or are changed/reworked
- "module" refers to user-installed modules in the .zip or .pck file format that are place in the games "mods" folder, most of the time they add species, events, bodyparts, etc.
