# BDCC-NSMOD
This mod aims to bring all the customization options that anyone would need.  
This mod also adds some modifications that I wanted in the game.  
This mod is fully compatible with modules for the base game, and also fully compatible with saves from the base game(for now).

# Modifications
- Cum capacity/production settings
- Dynamic NPC generation settings

# Confused?
- "mod" refers to BDCC-NSMOD, a modified version of the based game.  
- "modification" refers to things in BDCC-NSMOD that aren't in the base game, or are changed/reworked.  
- "module" refers to user-installed modules in the .zip or .pck file format that are place in the games "mods" folder, most of the time they add species, events, bodyparts, etc.  

### [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
